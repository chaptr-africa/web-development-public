<!-- Lesson 1: -->
## Brief History about Python Programming

### Introduction to Python Programming

- Python is a popular programming language. 
- It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- It can connect to database systems. 
- It can also read and modify files.
- It can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.

#### Benefits of Learning Python

- Easy to use and Learn: Python has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, unlike traditional languages like C, C++, Java, etc., making it easy for beginners to learn.
- Expressive Language: It allows programmers to express complex concepts in just a few lines of code or reduces Developer's Time.
- Interpreted Language: Python does not require compilation, allowing rapid development and testing. It uses Interpreter instead of Compiler.
- Object-Oriented Language: It supports object-oriented programming, making writing reusable and modular code easy.
- Open-Source Language: Python is open-source and free to use, distribute and modify.
- Extensible: Python can be extended with modules written in C, C++, or other languages.
- Learn Standard Library: Python's standard library contains many modules and functions that can be used for various tasks, such as string manipulation, web programming, and more.
- GUI Programming Support: Python provides several GUI frameworks, such as Tkinter and PyQt, allowing developers to create desktop applications easily.
- Integrated: Python can easily integrate with other languages and technologies, such as C/C++, Java, and . NET.
- Embeddable: Python code can be embedded into other applications as a scripting language.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Python automatically manages memory allocation, making it easier for developers to write complex programs without worrying about memory management.
- Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks: Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, Django, and Flask, that can be used to solve a wide range of problems.
- Versatility: Python is a universal language in various domains such as web development, machine learning, data analysis, scientific computing, and more.
- Large Community: Python has a vast and active community of developers contributing to its development and offering support. This makes it easy for beginners to get help and learn from experienced developers.
- Career Opportunities: Python is a highly popular language in the job market. Learning Python can open up several career opportunities in data science, artificial intelligence, web development, and more.
- High Demand: With the growing demand for automation and digital transformation, the need for Python developers is rising. Many industries seek skilled Python developers to help build their digital infrastructure.
- Increased Productivity: Python has a simple syntax and powerful libraries that can help developers write code faster and more efficiently. This can increase productivity and save time for developers and organizations.
- Big Data and Machine Learning: Python has become the go-to language for big data and machine learning. Python has become popular among data scientists and machine learning engineers with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and more.

## Python Installation and Set-Up on Visual Studio Code

### Python and Visual Studio Code Set-Up

In this lesson, we will learn to install Python and VSCode and run a simple Python code. 

#### Installing Python (Windows)

Downloading and installing the latest version of Python is straightforward. Go to Python.org and download the latest version for Windows.

After installing Python in your windows machine, check whether it is properly working by typing the following command in your powershell or cmd.

```bash
python --version
```

Installing Visual Studio Code



Installing VSCode is super simple. Download and install the stable build from the official website. The installer is available for all kinds of operating systems, including web browsers. 

Running Python Code on VSCode

After installing Python and VSCode, it is time to write a simple code and run the Python file within the IDE. 

At start, you will see the welcome note. Ignore that and go to File > New Text File or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + N to create a new file. After that, write a simple print expression to display “Hello World.”

print("Hello World.")

Save the file using Ctrl + S. Select the file directory and type the file name. Make sure to add `.py` at the end of the file name. 

To run the Python file, simply click on the Run button on the top left. It will initialize the terminal and run the Python file to display the output. 

Installing Essential Python Extensions

The VSCode’s Python extensions will provide us with the helping functionalities for code editing, docstrings, linting, formatting, debugging, testing, and environment selection. 

How to Install an Extension in VSCode

Click on the box icon on the activity bar or use a keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + X to open the extension panel. Type any keyword in the search bar to explore all kinds of extensions. 

In our case, we will type Python and install the Python extension by clicking on the install button.
