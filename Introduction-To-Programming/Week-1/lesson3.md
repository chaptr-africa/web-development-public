## What is a Programming Language?

- A programming language is a set of syntax and rules used to write programs. It allows programmers to communicate instructions to a computer.

# Examples of Programming Languages:

- Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby, and many more.

High-Level vs. Low-Level Languages:

- **High-Level Languages**: These are user-friendly and abstract away hardware details. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. They are easier to write, read, and maintain.

- **Low-Level Languages**: These are closer to machine code and offer more control over hardware. Examples include Assembly and C. They are more complex and provide finer control over system resources.

**Example**:

Python is a high-level language known for its readability and simplicity. It is often used for web development, data analysis, and automation.
