## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It involves writing code in a programming language to create software, applications, or systems.

- Programming is essential for developing software solutions, automating tasks, and solving complex problems. It is used in all modern technology, from websites to mobile apps.

- By writing code, programmers can create programs that perform specific tasks, such as calculating numbers, displaying images, or managing data.

Example:

Imagine you want to create a program that adds two numbers. You would write code that takes two inputs, adds them together, and outputs the result.
