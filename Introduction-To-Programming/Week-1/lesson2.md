## Components of a Computer:

- Hardware: The physical components of a computer, such as the CPU (Central Processing Unit), RAM (Random Access Memory), and storage devices (hard drives, SSDs).

- Software: Programs and operating systems that run on the hardware. Examples include operating systems like Windows, macOS, and applications like web browsers, word processors, and games.

# Role of Software:

- Software directs the hardware on how to operate. For example, an operating system manages the computer's resources, while applications perform specific tasks like browsing the web or editing documents.

- Programs are written to perform tasks and provide utilities for users. They can range from simple scripts to complex applications.

**Example**:

When you open a web browser, the software sends instructions to the hardware to fetch and display web pages. The browser's code handles user interactions, rendering content, and network communication.
