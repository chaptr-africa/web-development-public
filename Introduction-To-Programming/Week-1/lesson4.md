## What is CLI?

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which rely on visual elements like buttons and menus, the CLI requires users to type commands. This can often be faster and more powerful for advanced tasks.

# Advantages of CLI:

**Speed**: Once learned, commands can be faster to execute than navigating through GUIs.
 **Resource Efficiency**: CLI uses fewer system resources than GUIs.
 **Power and Flexibility**: CLI can perform complex and repetitive tasks more easily through scripting.

## Navigation Commands:

**cd** (change directory): Move between directories.

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory
  ```


  - **ls** (list): Display files and directories in the current directory.

```bash 
ls
```

**pwd** (print working directory): Show the current directory path.

```bash
pwd
```

## File Management Commands:

**mkdir** (make directory): Create a new directory.

```bash
mkdir new_directory
```
   

**rmdir** (remove directory): Delete an empty directory.

```bash 
rmdir empty_directory
```

**rm** (remove): Delete files or directories.

```bash 
rm file_name
```
```bash 
rm -r directory_name
```

    -r flag for recursive deletion

**cp** (copy): Copy files or directories. 

    ```bash
cp source_file destination_file
```

    ```bash
cp -r source_directory destination_directory
```
**mv** (move): Move or rename files or directories.

    ```bash
mv old_file_name new_file_name
```

    ```bash
mv file_name /new/path/
```
