# Systems Design Curriculum
This course delves into the intricate world of systems design and algorithms, equipping you with the knowledge and skills necessary to create efficient and scalable software solutions. It encompasses understanding the components of systems, different types of system models, and creating design diagrams. Throughout this course, you'll explore various concepts, from distributed systems to load balancing, containerization, cloud computing, and database design.  Below is a breakdown of the course:

## Week 1: Introduction to Systems Design
| Index | Lesson | Content Breakdown | Project/Quiz |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Introduction to Systems Design and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) | What is System Design? Importance of Systems Design. Components of Systems Design. Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Overview of different SDLC models (waterfall, iterative, spiral, agile). Different design diagrams (Gantt Chart, Flow Charts, Data Flow Diagrams). Sample interview questions | Create a simple flowchart for an authentication system |
| 1.2 | Introduction to Distributed Systems and Design Fundamentals | Understanding distributed systems. Scalability of distributed systems. Key characteristics of distributed systems. Types of distributed systems. Advantages and Disadvantages. Introduction to Design Fundamentals (Scaling, Caching, Load Balancing). What is scaling, and its types (Horizontal and Vertical). Importance of scaling. What is caching and its types (Server, client, distributed). Types of load balancers. How load balancers work and their pros and cons | |
| 1.3 | Design Fundamentals Continued and Databases | Proxies (Forward and Reverse Proxy). Message Queues. File Systems. Introduction to databases (Relational and Non-Relational). ACID Properties. Database Replication and Partitioning. Normalization. DB Design | Design a file system structure for an e-commerce website where product images and details need to be stored efficiently. |
| 1.4 | Test-Driven Development and Intro to Data Structures | What is Test-Driven Development? Benefits of TDD. Red/Green/Refactor Cycle. Basics of Data Structures and Algorithms. Introduction to key data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, Stacks and Queues, Graphs) | |
| 1.5 | Data Structures and Algorithms | Searching Algorithms (Linear Search and Binary Search), Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort), Divide and Conquer Algorithms (Merge Sort, QuickSort), Big O Notation and Time Complexity Analysis | ## End of Week Challenge ##: Implement a linear search algorithm to find an element in an array. Implement a simple sorting algorithm, such as Bubble Sort or Selection Sort, and use it to sort a list of data. Analyze the time complexity of the algorithms you implemented in earlier challenges and create Big O notation for them. |

## Week 2: Containerization
| Index | Lesson | Content Breakdown | Project/Quiz |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Introduction to Microservices and Containers | Introduction to Microservices. Introduction to Cloud Native. Introduction to Containers. Persisting Data | Challenge: Create a simple microservices-based application using containers (e.g., Docker) and deploy it in a cloud-native environment (e.g., Kubernetes) |
| 2.2 | Docker Compose and Kubernetes Concepts | Docker Compose. Container Registries. Kubernetes Concepts. Namespaces. | Challenge: Use Docker compose to set up a multi-container application and deploy it locally. Then push container images to a container registry.) |
| 2.3 | Kubernetes Pods, Selectors, and Workloads | Nodes. Pods. Selectors. Multi Container Pods. | Challenge: Set up a Kubernetes cluster (locally or using a cloud service) and create Pods with multiple containers, using selectors to organize and manage them. |
| 2.4 | Kubernetes Workloads and Services | Nodes. Pods. Selectors. Multi Container Pods. | Challenge: Deploy an application using Kubernetes Workloads and practice updating the application with minimal service disruption. |
| 2.5 | Storage, Scaling, and Observability | Storage & Persistence. Application Settings. Observability. Dashboards and Scaling | ## End of Week Challenge ##: Create a complete microservices-based application with containers, deploying it using Kubernetes, configuring application settings and observability, and implementing auto-scaling based on resource usage. |
